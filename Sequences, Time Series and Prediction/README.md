## Week 1

## Sequences and Prediction

> Hi Learners and welcome to this course on sequences and prediction! In this course we'll take a look at some of the unique considerations involved when handling sequential time series data -- where values change over time, like the temperature on a particular day, or the number of visitors to your web site. We'll discuss various methodologies for predicting future values in these time series, building on what you've learned in previous courses!

## Week 2

## Deep Neural Networks for Time Series

> Having explored time series and some of the common attributes of time series such as trend and seasonality, and then having used statistical methods for projection, let's now begin to teach neural networks to recognize and predict on time series!

* <b> Sequence bias </b>

> Sequence bias is when the order of things can impact the selection of things. For example, if I were to ask you your favorite TV show, and listed "Game of Thrones", "Killing Eve", "Travellers" and "Doctor Who" in that order, you're probably more likely to select 'Game of Thrones' as you are familiar with it, and it's the first thing you see. Even if it is equal to the other TV shows. So, when training data in a dataset, we don't want the sequence to impact the training in a similar way, so it's good to shuffle them up.
